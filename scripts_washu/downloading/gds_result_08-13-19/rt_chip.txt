2. Left atrial tissue of rats exposed to rapid atrial pacing
(Submitter supplied) Sustained atrial tachycardia leads to multiple molecular and cellular effects collectively defined as atrial tachycardia remodeling (ATR). ATR is thought to play a major role in the self-perpetuating nature of atrial fibrillation (AF) and has been a subject of intense research in large mammalian models of AF. Recently, rodents are increasingly used to gain insight on the pathophysiology AF. However, little is known regarding the effects of rapid pacing on the atria of rats and mice mainly due to technical challenges in electrophysiological studies of unanesthetized rodents. more...

42. Expression data from healthy and diastolic heart failure rats
(Submitter supplied) Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is rising, whose morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs are similar to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Although substantial molecular pathways lead to the changes in organ and tissue levels, there are still lack of successful treatments for HFpEF given the complexity molecular networks remaining unknown. Here we report that the significantly changed genes of HFpEF rats associates positively with inflammatory processes and immune responses while negatively with calcium ion transport into cytosol. more...

65. Aberrant DNA methylation of hypothalamic angiotensin receptor in prenatal-programmed hypertension
(Submitter supplied) Malnutrition during pregnancy, which causes prenatal exposure to excessive glucocorticoid, induces adverse metabolic programming leading to hypertension in offspring. Pregnant rats receiving a low-protein diet exhibited moderate downregulation of 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2, which inactivates corticosterone, in the placenta, resulting in prenatal exposure to excessive corticosterone. In offspring of pregnant rats receiving a low-protein diet or dexamethasone, mRNA expression of angiotensin receptor type 1a (Agtr1a) in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus was upregulated, concurrent with reduced expression of DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), reduced binding of DNMT3a to the Agtr1a promoter, and DNA demethylation, suggesting hypothalamic Agtr1a expression is epigenetically modulated by excess glucocorticoid. more...

The mTORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and analogs (rapalogs) are approved for treating of TSC and LAM. Due to their cytostatic and not cytocidal action, discontinuation of treatment leads to tumor regrowth and decline in pulmonary function. Therefore, life-long rapalog treatment is proposed for the control of TSC and LAM lesions, which increases the chances for the development of acquired drug resistance. more...

153. Identifiation of lncRNA expression profiles and ceRNA analysis in the spinal cord of morphine tolerance rats
(Submitter supplied) The mechanism of morphine tolerance remains unclear, and lncRNA have been promising molecule in many pathophysiological processes. However, the role of lncRNA on morphine tolerance hasn’t been explored yet. So we explore this issue, and our results indicated that  the expression profiles of lncRNAs have changed in  morphine tolerance rats as compared with normal rats, and among those, some differentially expressed lncRNAs might be new therapeutic targets for morphine tolerance.

384. Alteration of gene expression profile of cerebelllar neuron-enriched cultures from neonatal rats by nicotine, acetamiprid, or imidacloprid treatment [imidacloprid]
(Submitter supplied) Neonicotinoids are considered safe because of their low affinities to mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) relative to insect nAChRs. However, because of importance of nAChRs in mammalian brain development, there remains a need to establish the safety of chronic neonicotinoid exposures with regards to children’s health. Here we examined the effects of long-term (14 days) and low dose (1 μM) exposure of neuron-enriched cultures from neonatal rat cerebellum to nicotine and two neonicotinoids: acetamiprid and imidacloprid. more...

389. Comparison of Gene expression profiling of granulosa cells treated with follicle stimulating hormone or constitutively active protein kinase A
(Submitter supplied) PKA activation by FSH is essential to transduce FSH-mediated effects on granulosa cell proliferation, differentiation and steroidogenesis. However, It is unknown whether activation of PKA is sufficient to account for the entire program of granulosa cell responses to FSH. We addressed this question by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of signaling pathways and gene expression profiles of granulosa cells stimulated with FSH or expressing a constitutively active PKA mutant, PKA-CQR.

478. Nerve-derived Schwann cell precursors, acting in a paracrine fashion, are essential for mammalian digit tip regeneration [RAT]
(Submitter supplied) Multi-tissue regenerative capacity is lost in adult mammals with the exception of the distal digit, which regenerates via largely-uncharacterized mechanisms.  Here, we demonstrate that following adult mouse distal digit removal, nerve-associated Schwann cell precursors (N-SCPs) dedifferentiate and secrete growth factors that promote expansion of the blastema and digit regeneration.  Specifically, when N-SCPs were dysregulated or ablated, mesenchymal precursor proliferation in the blastema was decreased, nail and bone regeneration were impaired, and regeneration could be rescued by transplantation of exogenous N-SCPs. more...

536. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors as hypothalamic targets of developmental programming in male rats
(Submitter supplied) Though obesity is a global epidemic, the physiological mechanisms involved are little understood. Recent advances reveal that susceptibility to obesity can be programmed by maternal and neonatal nutrition. Specifically, a maternal low protein diet during pregnancy causes decreased intrauterine growth, rapid postnatal catch-up growth and increased risk for diet-induced obesity. Given that the synthesis of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is nutritionally regulated and 5-HT is a trophic factor, we hypothesized that maternal diet influences fetal 5-HT exposure, which then influences central appetite network development and the subsequent efficacy of 5-HT to control energy balance in later life. more...

(Submitter supplied) Vascular calcification (VC) is often associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms linking VC to these diseases have yet to be elucidated. Here we report that MDM2-induced polyubiquitination of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) mediates VC. Loss of HDAC1 activity via either chemical inhibitor or genetic ablation enhanced VC. HDAC1 protein, but not mRNA, was reduced in cell and animal calcification models and in human calcified coronary artery. more...

594. Novel RNA- and FMRP-binding protein TRF2-S regulates axonal mRNA transport and presynaptic plasticity
(Submitter supplied) Despite considerable evidence that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate mRNA transport and local translation in dendrites, roles for axonal RBPs are poorly understood.  Here we demonstrate that a nontelomeric isoform of telomere repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2-S) is a novel RBP that regulates axonal plasticity.  TRF2-S interacts directly with target mRNAs to facilitate their axonal delivery.  The process is antagonized by fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). more...

(Submitter supplied) Symptoms of the dopamine dysregulation syndrome in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are close to those observed in psychostimulant addiction. This suggests that dopamine replacement therapy shares some properties with potentially addictive drugs. A remaining challenge is to understand the neuroadaptations leading to compulsive dopaminergic medication use. To this end,  the reinforcing properties of the D2/D3 agonist pramipexole (PPX) were assessed after chronic exposure to L-dopa in an alpha-synuclein PD rat model.

655. Effect of furan on transcriptomic and gene-specific DNA methylation changes in the livers of Fischer 344 rats in a two-year carcinogenicity study
(Submitter supplied) The carcinogenic effect of furan, a potent hepatotoxicant and rodent liver carcinogen, has been attributed to genotoxic and non-genotoxic, including epigenetic, changes in the liver; however, the mechanisms of the furan liver tumorigenicity are still unclear.  The goal of the present study was to investigate the role of transcriptomic and epigenetic events in the development of hepatic lesions in Fischer (F344) rats induced by furan treatment in a classic two-year rodent tumorigenicity bioassay.  Male F344 rats were distributed randomly into control and experimental groups.  Rats from the experimental groups were treated by gavage 5 days/week with either 0.92 or 2.0 mg furan/kg body weight (bw) in corn oil for 104 weeks.  Rats from control group received corn oil only.  High-throughput whole genome microarray analyses demonstrated distinctive dose-dependent alterations in gene expression in the furan-induced liver lesions.  A total of 2073 and 2422 genes was found to be differentially expressed in the furan-induced liver lesions in rats treated with 0.92 and 2.0 mg furan/kg bw, respectively, as compared to normal liver tissue.  Approximately 60% (1340) of the differentially expressed genes were common to both treatment groups.  In silico analysis of the common differentially expressed genes revealed the presence of CpG island in 51% (679) of the genes, suggesting that they may be epigenetically regulated.  Promoter methylation analysis of individual differentially expressed CpG island-containing genes demonstrated dose-dependent gene-specific methylation changes that were highly correlated with gene expression.  Our findings illustrate that gene-specific DNA methylation changes have functional consequences and may contribute to the development of furan-induced pathologic liver lesions.

656. Endothelin-Mediated Changes in Gene Expression in Isolated Purified Rat Retinal Ganglion Cells
(Submitter supplied) A growing body of evidence suggests that the vasoactive peptides endothelins (ETs) and their receptors (primarily the ETB receptor) are contributors to neurodegeneration in glaucoma. However, ET’s actions in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine ETs effects on gene expression in primary RGCs. Primary RGCs treated with 100nM of ET-1, ET-2 or ET-3 for 24 hours was used as cell model to investigation the role of endothelins in gene expression.

730. Expression data from NRK-52E cells treated with monuron for 6h, 24h and 72h and rats exposed to monuron for 72h.
(Submitter supplied) Monuron (1,1-dimethyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl) urea) is a non-selective phenylurea herbicide, widely used in the developing countries, however concerns have been raised about it toxicity and carcinogenicity. Monuron was evaluated by the National Toxicology Program (1988) and shown to be a male rat-specific renal carcinogen; however the mechanism of carcinogenesis is unknown. In this study we have examined the effect of sub-cytotoxic exposure to monuron (250µM) at 6h, 24h and 72h on the whole-genome expression profile in a rat proximal renal tubule cell line (NRK-52E). more...

731. A comparison of physiological and transcriptome responses to water deprivation and salt loading in the rat supraoptic nucleus
(Submitter supplied) Salt loading (SL) and water deprivation (WD) are experimental challenges that are often used to study the osmotic circuitry of the brain. Central to this circuit is the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus, which is responsible for the biosynthesis of the hormones, vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT), and their transport to terminals that reside in the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Upon osmotic challenge evoked by a change in blood volume or osmolality, the SON undergoes a function related plasticity that creates an environment that allows for an appropriate hormone response. more...

753. Early Leptin Intervention Reverses Perturbed Energy Balance Regulating Hypothalamic Neuropeptides in the Pre- and Postnatal Calorie Restricted Offspring
(Submitter supplied) Pre- and postnatal calorie restriction is associated with postnatal growth restriction,  reduced circulating leptin concentrations and perturbed energy balance. Hypothalamic  regulation of energy balance demonstrates enhanced orexigenic (NPY, AgRP) and  diminished anorexigenic (POMC, CART) neuropeptide expression (PN21) setting the  stage for subsequent development of obesity. Leptin replenishment during the early  postnatal period (PN2-PN8) led to reversing the hypothalamic orexigenic:anorexigenic  neuropeptide ratio at PN21 by only reducing the orexigenic (NPY, AgRP) without  affecting the anorexigenic (POMC, CART) neuropeptide expression. more...

(Submitter supplied) In many mammals, halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon (HAH) exposure causes wasting syndrome, defined as lethal weight loss as a result of severe and persistent hypophagia. The most potent HAH in causing wasting is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD), which exerts its toxic effects through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) – a transcription factor. Because TCDD toxicity is thought to predominantly arise from dysregulation of AHR-transcribed genes, we hypothesized that wasting syndrome is due to TCDD-induced dysregulation of genes involved in regulation of food-intake. more...

794. Down-regulation as the dominant hippocampal gene expression profile with voluntary resistance wheel running by DNA microarray analysis
(Submitter supplied) Exercise improves brain function enhancing neuronal plasticity and cognitive enhancement. For voluntary resistance wheel running (RWR) exercise, with a load of 30% of body weight, we reported enhancement of neurogenesis and spatial memory associated with hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling compared to wheel running (WR) without a load (Lee et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2013). Despite these new evidences, mechanisms for RWR-induced improvement of hippocampal function remained to be clarified. In the present study, we have utilized the high-throughput DNA microarray approach to gain deep insight into molecular mechanisms underlying these changes that could be novel targets of RWR-induced hippocampal plasticity. To do so, whole genome (4x44K) high-density oligonucleotide microarrays were used to monitor the expression level of gene transcripts in the hippocampus of rats voluntary running for 4 weeks in comparison with sedentary animals. These rats showed a significant decrease in average running distance although average work levels immensely increased 12-fold in the RWR group, resulting in muscular adaptation for the fast-twitch plantaris muscle. DNA microarray analysis revealed that 122 (sedentary x WR) and 157 (sedentary x RWR) genes were up-regulated (> 1.5-fold change) as compared with 97 (sedentary x WR) and 467 (sedentary x RWR) down-regulated genes (< 0.75-fold change). Functional categorization using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed expression pattern changes in the major categories of disease and disorders, molecular functions and physiological system development and function. Among these, RWR up-regulated genes such as NFATc1, AVPR1A and FGFR4, which are crucial role for neuronal development and its functions. The down-regulated inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL10, IL2RA, TNF) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL13, CCR4) might be important to neuronal dysfunction and vulnerability. Taken together, these gene candidates are suggested to play a critical role in hippocampal plasticity. This is a first study presenting not only new information into the voluntary RWR influenced transcriptome in the rat hippocampus, but also provides a hypothesis for the RWR influenced enhancement in brain function.

843. Inhalation exposure of hexanal in rats (mRNA)
(Submitter supplied) To further development of insight into the mechanism of toxicity, it is important to employ whole genome microarray expression profiling as a discovery platform to ientify genes with the potential to distinguish hexanal exposure across an exposure range relevant for toxicologic mechanisms. However, few reports have described the effect of hexanal on gene expression profiles using animal model. In this respect, we studied the expression profiles of mRNAs in hexanal-exposed in rats by microarray analysis.

849. Direct genesis of functional rodent and human Schwann cells from skin mesenchymal precursors (rat)
(Submitter supplied) Recent reports of directed reprogramming have raised questions about the stability of cell lineages.  Here, we have addressed this issue, focusing upon skin-derived precursors (SKPs), a dermally-derived precursor cell.  We show by lineage tracing that murine SKPs from dorsal skin originate from mesenchymal and not neural crest-derived cells.  These mesenchymally-derived SKPs can, without genetic manipulation, generate functional Schwann cells, a neural crest cell type, and are highly similar at the transcriptional level to Schwann cells isolated from the peripheral nerve. more...

891. Hong Shan Capsule (HSC) offers radioprotection and modulates acute lethal total-body irradiation-induced alterations of gene expression in rats
(Submitter supplied) To further investigate the potential molecular basis of the protective effects of HSC on irradiation (6.5Gy)  damage, gene expression analysis was conducted on rats liver tissues using microarrays.Pre-treatment with HSC prevented differential expression of 66% (1,398 genes) of 2,126 genes differentially expressed in response to radiation. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were mainly involved in a total of 32 pathways, such as olfactory transduction,  uroactive ligand-receptor interaction, pathways in cancer, calcium signaling pathway, vascular smooth muscle contraction, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR）signaling pathway, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-STAT) signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway.Our analysis indicated that the pretreatment of rats with HSC attenuated radiation-induced these pathways, such as multiple MAPK pathways, suggesting that the protective effect of HSC acts mainly through the attenuation of these pathways.

(Submitter supplied) To further investigate the potential molecular basis of the protective effects of MASM on irradiation (6.5Gy)  damage, gene expression analysis was conducted on rats liver tissues using microarrays. Pre-treatment with MASM prevented differential expression of 53% (766 genes) of 1445 genes differentially expressed in response to radiation. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were mainly involved in a total of 21 pathways, such as metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, and MAPK signaling pathway.

(Submitter supplied) Since the liver is the central organ of metabolism, changes in diet have a great impact on this organ and overall on health with aging. It is well known that dietary fat source strongly influences many parameters of the hepatic mitochondria. These changes includes modification of lipid composition of mitochondrial membrane, affecting the mtETC functions, oxidative stress and mtDNA alterations. We used microarrays to detail the changes in gene expression provides by feeding lifelong on different dietary fat sources, and identified distinct classes of up and down-regulated genes during aging under different dietary conditions.

(Submitter supplied) Adolescent binge alcohol exposure has been previously shown to have long-lasting effects on the expression of hypothalamic genes that regulate the stress response, even in the absence of subsequent adult alcohol exposure. Those data suggested that alcohol can induce permanent gene expression changes, potentially through epigenetic modifications. Importantly, epigenetic modifications can be transmitted to future generations therefore, in these studies we investigated the effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure on hypothalamic gene expression patterns in the F1 generation offspring. more...

(Submitter supplied) Located in the perisinusoidal space of Disse, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) communicate with all other liver cell types by physical association and / or by producing cytokines and chemokines. In liver disease and folllowing liver transplantation, elevated levels of endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide: LPS) stimulate HSCs to produce increased amounts of cytokines and chemokines. Transcriptomic analysis of cultured HSCs stimulated with LPS yields a survey of expression changes which potentially modulate the hepatic inflammatory and immune responses.

In the present study, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Pdx-1 in rat or human islets also stimulates cell replication. Moreover, co-overexpression of Pdx-1 with another homeodomain transcription factor, Nkx6.1, has an additive effect on proliferation compared to either factor alone, implying discrete activating mechanisms. more...

(Submitter supplied) Fipronil (CAS #: 120068-37-3), a widely used insecticide, has been described as a thyroid disruptor in rat inducing a marked increase in thyroxine (T4) clearance resulting in a decrease in T4 plasma concentration. These effects seem to require the bioactivation of fipronil via its biotransformation into fipronil sulfone by cytochromes P450 (CYP). Here, we hypothesized that fipronil-induced thyroid disruption may, at least in part, result from the induction of hepatic enzymes involved in the metabolism of thyroid hormones. more...

1041. Genome-wide mRNA expression profiles of FACS-enriched rat beta cells freshly isolated from neonatal (postnatal day 2-3) and adult (10 weeks-old) Wistar rats
(Submitter supplied) The lower glucose-responsiveness of neonatal beta cells is generally considered a sign of endocrine immaturity. We compared mRNA profiles of neonatal and 10-weeks old rat beta cells to see how their gene expression changes with functional maturation.  Neonatal beta cells showed a lower glucose-inducible increment in insulin production than adult cells. This was in part explained by basal protein synthetic hyperactivity of neonatal cells: while at 2.5mM glucose 80% of neonatal beta cells were recruited into active protein synthesis, 10 mM glucose was required to achieve a similar fraction of active adult beta cells. more...

(Submitter supplied) In vitro expansion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) remains a challenge in stem cell research and its application. We hypothesize that high density culture is able to expansion EPCs from bone marrow by mimicking cell-cell interactions of the bone marrow niche. To test the hypothesis, rat bone marrow cells were either cultured in high density by seeding or cultured in regular density. Flow cytometric analyses of the cells cultured for 15 days showed that high density cells exhibited smaller cell size and higher levels of marker expression related to EPCs when compared to regular density cultured cells. more...

1103. The Refilin/Filamin complex regulates filipodia dynamics in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.
(Submitter supplied) Actin assembly and dynamics control the shape, motility and functions of diverse cell types. Programme for controlling theses dynamics is hard-coded into actin binding proteins and regulatory proteins. Refilins (RefilinA and RefilinB) are short lived regulatory proteins that interact with the actin-binding protein Filamin to convert it from an actin branching protein into one that bundles. We here show that different mechanisms converge to increase Refilin level in brain NG2+ precursor cells (polydendrocytes) committed to differentiate into the oligodendrocyte lineage. more...

1105. A master cistromic circuit governing hepatic fibrogenesis [expression array]
(Submitter supplied) Liver fibrosis is a reversible wound-healing response to liver injury and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are central cellular players that mediate hepatic fibrogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern this process remain unclear. Expression profiling was used to explore the potential impact of VDR signaling in TGFβ1 and TGFβ1+1,25(OH)2D3-treated primary rat HSCs. Notably, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment attenuated the culture-induced activation of HSCs, such that the transcriptome of treated cells closely resembled that of freshly isolated quiescent cells (Figure 2A), and co-treatment of 1,25(OH)2D3  together with TGFβ resulted in considerable repression of a large set of TGFβ induced genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Studies have shown that HIV-infected patients develop neurocognitive disorders characterized by neuronal dysfunction. The lack of productive infection of neurons by HIV suggests that viral and cellular proteins, with neurotoxic activities, released from HIV-1-infected target cells can cause this neuronal deregulation. The viral protein R (Vpr), a protein encoded by HIV-1, has been shown to alter the expression of various important cytokines and inflammatory proteins in infected and uninfected cells; however the mechanisms involved remain unclear. more...

1141. HIV-1 Tat protein promotes neuronal dysfunction through disruption of microRNAs.
(Submitter supplied) Over the last decade, small noncoding RNA molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in the expression and function of eukaryotic genomes. It has been suggested that viral infections and neurological disease outcome may also be shaped by the influence of small RNAs. This has prompted us to suggest that HIV infection alters the endogenous miRNA expression patterns, thereby contributing to neuronal deregulation and AIDS dementia. more...

1148. Expression data from cyclically stretched engineered neonatal rat ventricuar myocyte (NRVM) tissues
(Submitter supplied) Mechanical overload in the heart induces pathological remodeling that typcially leads to heart failure. We sought to build an in vitro model of heart failure by applying cyclic stretch to engineered isotropic (iso) and anisotropic (aniso) NRVM tissues. We used micoarrays to determine the effects of longitudinal and transvserse cyclic stretch on gene expression in engineered NRVM cardiac tissues. We found that cyclic stretch induced up-regulation of several known indicators of heart faliure, independent of the direction of stretch.

1159. Functional Comparison of Chronological and In Vitro Aging: Differential Role of the Cytoskeleton and Mitochondria in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
(Submitter supplied) Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are of high relevance for the regeneration of mesenchymal tissues such as bone and cartilage. The promising role of MSCs in cell-based therapies and tissue engineering appears to be limited due to a decline of their regenerative potential with increasing donor age, their limited availability in human tissues and the need of in vitro expansion prior to treatment. We therefore aimed to determine to which degree in vitro aging and chronological aging may be similar processes or if in vitro culture-related changes at the cellular and molecular level are at least altered as a function of donor age. more...

1213. Sperm mRNA transcripts are indicators of sub-chronic low dose testicular injury in the Fischer 344 rat 
(Submitter supplied) Current human reproductive risk assessment methods rely on semen and serum hormone analyses, which are not easily comparable to the histopathological endpoints and mating studies used in animal testing. Because of these limitations, there is a need to develop universal evaluations that reliably reflect male reproductive function. We hypothesized that toxicant-induced testicular injury can be detected in sperm using mRNA transcripts as indicators of insult. more...

1246. The Influence of Sleep Deprivation on Hippocampal CA1 Gene Expression: Relation to Stress and Aging
(Submitter supplied) Sleep deprivation (SD) in young adults is associated with metabolic, stress and cognitive responses that are also characteristic of brain aging. Given that sleep architecture changes with age, including increased fragmentation and decreased slow wave activity, it seems reasonable to investigate potential molecular relationships between SD and aging in brain tissue. Here, we tested the hypothesis that young rats exposed to 24 or 72 hour SD would respond with stress and aging-like shifts in brain hippocampal CA1 gene expression. more...

We could not identify cells with hypoblast features in rat BM, but they appeared after prolonged in vitro culture under rMAPC conditions. However, rMAPC culture conditions supported the very rapid isolation of new lines with nascent hypoblast features from rat blastocysts that were more homogenous than XEN-P cells isolated on feeders. more...

1287. Male-dominant activation of rat renal organic anion transporter 1 (Oat1) and 3 (Oat3) expression by transcription factor BCL6
(Submitter supplied) Organic anion transporters 1 (Oat1) and 3 (Oat3) play a critical role in transport of organic anions, including frequently prescribed drugs, across cell membranes in proximal tubules of kidneys. In rats, these transporters are known to be male-predominant and testosterone dependently expressed. The molecular mechanisms that are involved in the sex-dependent expression are unknown. Our aim was to identify genes that show a sex-dependent expression and could be involved in sex-dependent regulation of Oat1 and Oat3.

1392. Dioxin effect on the pituitary and hypothalamic expression of genes in male fetal Wistar rats
(Submitter supplied) 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) causes the many forms of reproductive toxicity, such as defects in sexual behaviors, in pups of which mother is exposed to this substance at lower doses. However, the mechanism underlying these defects remains to be clarified in spite of many researches conducted so far. Our previous studies have revealed that maternal treatment with TCDD attenuates the production of pituitary gonadotropins [luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone] in the late fetuses, leading to the impairment of sexual behavior in adulthood. more...

1430. Multiple chronic pain states are associated with a common amino acid-changing allele in KCNS1
(Submitter supplied) Not all patients with nerve injury develop neuropathic pain. The extent of nerve damage and age at the time of injury are two of the few risk factors identified to date. In addition, preclinical studies show that neuropathic pain variance is heritable. To define such factors further, we performed a large-scale gene profiling experiment which plotted global expression changes in the rat dorsal root ganglion in three peripheral neuropathic pain models. more...

1457. Neurotoxin tetrodotoxin TTX withdrawal induced neuronal activity: RNA Pol II is poised for rapid induction of arc and other neuronal VF-IEGs
(Submitter supplied) Transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs) in neurons is exquisitely sensitive to neuronal activity, but the mechanism underlying the earliest of these transcription events is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that very fast IEGs (VF-IEGs) such as arc/arg3.1 are poised for rapid transcription by the stalling of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) just downstream of the transcription start site. RNAi-depletion of two subunits of a mediator of Pol II stalling, Negative Elongation Factor, reduces Pol II occupancy of the arc promoter and compromises rapid induction of arc and other VF-IEGs. more...

1467. Inhibitory Actions of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) on Ovarian Primordial Follicle Assembly
(Submitter supplied) The current study was designed to investigate the actions of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) on primordial follicle assembly.  Ovarian primordial follicles develop from the breakdown of oocyte nests during fetal development for the human and immediately after birth in rodents.  AMH was found to inhibit primordial follicle assembly, decrease the initial primordial follicle pool size and promote the persistence of small oocyte nests in a rat ovarian organ culture. more...

1471. Gene expression in response to axotomy in organotypical slices co-cultures
(Submitter supplied) Brain slice cultures offer advantages over other in vitro methods, as they mimic numerous in vivo aspects. For most purposes, slices of the developing brain, termed organotypic slice cultures , preserve a high degree of cellular differentiation and tissue organization. The entorhino-hippocampal connection (EHP) is the main entrance of information to the hippocampus proper and the dentate gyrus. Also it has some specific features that make them particularly interesting in studies of axonal regeneration: (i) the culture method obviates the need for extensive animal surgery and requires less time than other in vivo approaches; (ii) the EHP is reproduced easily in vitro in cultures with a degree of laminar specificity similar to that found in vivo; (iii) the EHP is myelinated both in vitro and in vivo; and (iv) most of the cellular and molecular barriers to axon regeneration are present after the axotomy of the EHP in vitro. more...

(Submitter supplied) To investigate the determinants of neuronal survival after traumatic brain injury, we compared the transcriptional profiles of dying (Fluoro-Jade-positive) and immediately adjacent surviving (Fluoro-Jade-negative) neurons from the CA3 subfield of the rat hippocampus 24 hours after experimental TBI. We found that hippocampal neurons that survive TBI invariably express high levels of genes that have cellular functions involved in survival, regeneration, development, proliferation, neuronal plasticity such as cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), brain-derived-neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1). more...

1510. Role of the Yersinia pestis Virulence Plasmid in Evading a Protective Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte Response During the Early Stages of Bubonic Plague
(Submitter supplied) A delay in the mammalian inflammatory response is a prominent feature of infection with Yersinia pestis, the agent of bubonic and pneumonic plague. Y. pestis factors have been identified that either do not stimulate a normal inflammatory response, or actively suppress it. Prominent among these are components of the Type III secretion system that is encoded on the Yersinia virulence plasmid (pYV). We used a rat model of bubonic plague to characterize the kinetics and extent of the mammalian transcriptomic response to infection with wild-type or pYV-negative Y. more...

1515. Effect of iodine on early stage thyroid autonomy
(Submitter supplied) Thyroid autonomy is a frequent cause of thyrotoxicosis in regions with iodine deficiency. Epidemiological data suggest that the prevalence of thyroid autonomy is not only inversely correlated with the ambient iodine supply, but that iodide may also influence the course of pre-existing thyroid autonomy with possibly different effects on thyroid growth and function. Iodine slows TSH effects on thyroid growth stimulation and this effect is more pronounced in thyrocytes with constitutive cAMP activation i.e. more...

1516. Effector T cells driving monophasic vs relapse/remitting experimental autoimmune uveitis show unique pathway signatures
(Submitter supplied) Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in Lewis rats is a model for the clinical heterogeneity of human uveitis. The autoantigens inducing disease in the rat are also seen in human disease. Depending upon the specific autoantigen used, the experimental disease course can be either monophasic or relapsing/remitting and appears to be dictated by the T cell effector phenotype elicited. We investigated potential differences between monophasic and relapsing/remitting effector T cells using transcriptomic profiling and pathway analysis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Temporal changes of gene expression from 1-wk- to 5-wk-old rat in kidney and lung, and the effect of prior growth inhibition on these genetic changes. In mammals, body growth is rapid in early life but decelerates with age. Somatic growth deceleration is caused by a gradual decline in cell proliferation that occurs simultaneously in many different organs, but is not caused by a hormonal mechanism. We hypothesize that growth deceleration is driven by a postnatal genetic program that occurs coordinately in multiple organs. more...

1649. Bioinformatic profiling of the transcriptional response of adult rat cardiomyocytes to distinct fatty acids
(Submitter supplied) Diabetes mellitus, obesity, and dyslipidemia increase risk for cardiovascular disease, and expose the heart to high plasma fatty acid (FA) levels. Recent studies suggest that distinct FA species are cardiotoxic (e.g., palmitate), while others are cardioprotective (e.g., oleate), although the molecular mechanisms mediating these observations are unclear. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differential effects of distinct FA species (varying carbon length and degree of saturation) on adult rat cardiomyocyte (ARC) gene expression. more...

1658. Network analysis of differentially expressed genes in a rat model of neonatal HI encephalopathy +/- antioxidant
(Submitter supplied) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy can lead to severe brain damage, and  is a common cause of neurological handicaps in adulthood. The modified Levine method (Rice model) has been widely used as an animal model of this condition, which can be rescued by the administration of an antioxidant such as 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (MCI-186). In the present study, by using the Rice model, we performed comprehensive gene expression and gene network analyses of neonatal HI brain insult with and without MCI-186 administration via a DNA microarray to help elucidate the molecular events responsible for the selective vulnerability of neurons to an HI insult and the underlying mechanisms of the effect of MCI-186 on the pathophysiological events. more...

1683. Identification of biomarkers that distinguish chemical contaminants using a gradient feature selection method
(Submitter supplied) There are many toxic chemicals to contaminate the world and cause harm to human and other organisms. How to quickly discriminate these compounds and characterize their potential molecular mechanism and toxicity is essential. High through put transcriptomics profiles such as microarray have been proven useful to identify biomarkers for different classification and toxicity prediction purposes. Here we aim to investigate how to use microarray to predict chemical contaminants and their possible mechanisms. more...

1685. Cardiotoxicity of tubulin binders
(Submitter supplied) The use of tubulin binders (TBs) in oncology indications often is associated with cardiotoxicity, the mechanism of which has not been elucidated.  We observed that a single administration of TBs to rats caused an increase in the number of mitotic figures in the myocardial interstitium after 24 hours.  We therefore hypothesized that interstitial cells are the primary target of TBs.  To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the acute effects of a single intravenous administration of 3 reference TBs, colchicine (0.2 and 2 mg/kg), vinblastine (0.5 and 3 mg/kg), and vincristine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) 6 and 24 hours after dosing. more...

(Submitter supplied) The goal of this study was to identify candidate genes that may influence alcohol consumption by comparing gene expression in 5 brain regions of alcohol-naïve iP and P.NP rats.  Background: Selectively bred P (alcohol preferring) and NP (alcohol non-preferring) rats differ greatly in alcohol preference, in part due to a highly significant QTL on chromosome 4. Reciprocal congenic strains in which the iP chromosome 4 QTL interval was transferred to the iNP background (NP.P) and the iNP chromosome 4 QTL was transferred to the iP background (P.NP) exhibited alcohol consumption scores that correlated with the introgressed interval. more...

We conducted two experiments with the hope of defining some of the molecular interactors for four separate behaviours: sugar feeding, locomotor activity in a novel field, and acoustic startle reflex, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex, which have been linked to prefrontal cortex dopaminergic function or as predictors of sensorimotor gating in diseases such as schizophrenia. more...

1724. mRNA Levels in the Rat Liver Display Strain-Specific, Hereditary and AHR-Dependent Components
(Submitter supplied) Background The rat is a major model organism in toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics, and the use of steady-state hepatic mRNA levels to predict and understand drug toxicity and mechanism is well-established. Surprisingly, the inter- and intra-strain variability of rat mRNA expression has not been evaluated, nor has the extent of its hereditability been established. We address these issues by studying three rat strains (Long-Evans, Hans/Wistar, and Sprague-Dawley) and two F2 lines derived from Long-Evans x Hans/Wistar crosses. more...

1725. Dioxin lethality: aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated gene expression in a rat resistant model
(Submitter supplied) Major toxicities of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) result from dysregulation of gene expression mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).  Dioxin-like chemicals alter expression of numerous genes in liver but the specific genes whose dysregulation leads to toxicities such as wasting, hepatotoxicity and lethality have not been identified.  We searched for genes that are most likely to be key to dioxin toxicity by using gene expression arrays to contrast hepatic gene expression after TCDD treatment in dioxin-sensitive rats (that carry wildtype AHR) with gene expression in H/W(Kuopio) rats which are highly resistant to dioxin toxicity due to a major deletion in the AHR's transactivation domain (TAD). more...

(Submitter supplied) Unlike other terminally differentiated cell types, vascular SMCs display remarkable phenotypic plasticity. The adult, differentiated state is traditionally defined by expression of well-characterized SMC contractile genes. Extracellular cues, however, can induce contractile SMCs to remodel toward a synthetic state characterized by a spectrum of proliferative, migratory, and inflammatory phenotypes. We used whole-genome expression arrays to to identify genes associated with SMC phenotypic modulation.

1870. Cluster analysis of rat pancreatic islet gene mRNA levels after culture in low, intermediate and high [glucose]
(Submitter supplied) Background: Survival and function of insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells are markedly altered by changes in nutrient availability. In vitro, culture in 10 rather than 2mM glucose improves rodent β-cell survival and function whereas glucose concentrations above 10mM are deleterious.  Aim-Method: To identify the mechanisms of such β-cell plasticity, we tested the effects of a 18h culture at 2, 5, 10 and 30mM glucose on the transcriptome of rat islets precultured for 1 week at 10mM glucose (Affymetrix Rat 230.2 arrays). more...

(Submitter supplied) Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating disease for which currently no therapy is available. It is a progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene, resulting in an expansion of polyglutamines at the N-terminal end of the encoded protein, designated huntingtin, and the accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. Not only is there a loss of normal huntingtin function, upon expansion of the CAG repeat there is also a gain of toxic function of the huntingtin protein and this affects a wide range of cellular processes. more...

(Submitter supplied) The goal of this study was to identify changes in muscle gene expression that may contribute to loss of adaptability of old muscle. Muscle atrophy was induced in young adult (6-month) and old (32-month) male Brown Norway/F344 rats by two weeks of hind limb suspension (HS) and soleus muscles were analyzed by cDNA microarrays. We conclude that a cold shock response may be part of a compensatory mechanism in muscles undergoing atrophy to preserve remaining muscle mass and that RBM3 may be a therapeutic target to prevent muscle loss.

1946. Gene Expression Changes in Laser Capture Microdissected Nasal Respiratory Epithelium of Rats Exposed to Hydrogen Sulfide
(Submitter supplied) Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a naturally occurring gas that is also associated with several industries.  The potential for widespread human inhalation exposure to this toxic gas is recognized as a public health concern.  The nasal epithelium is particularly susceptible to H2S-induced pathology.  Injury to and regeneration of the nasal respiratory mucosa occurred in animals with ongoing H2S exposure suggesting that the regenerated respiratory epithelium undergoes an adaptive response and becomes resistant to further H2S induced toxicity. more...

1949. Differential susceptibility of Wistar Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats to diesel exhaust particle exposure.
(Submitter supplied) DEP exposure is linked to increases in cardiovascular effects. This effect is enhanced in individuals with pre-existing disease. Animal models of cardiovascular disease are used to study this susceptibility. The heart is rich in mitochondria, which produce high levels of free radicals, leading to inactivation of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. We hypothesized that a 4-wk DEP inhalation would result in strain-related structural impairment of cardiac mitochondria and changes in these enzyme activities in WKY and SHR. more...

(Submitter supplied) d-serine is naturally present throughout the human body.  It is also used as add-on therapy for treatment-refractory schizophrenia. d-Serine interacts with the strychnine-insensitive glycine binding site of NMDA receptor, and this interaction could lead to potentially toxic activity (i.e., excitotoxicity) in brain tissue.  The transcriptomic changes that occur in the brain after d-serine exposure have not been fully explored. more...

2095. Acute Gene Induction by Tienilic Acid in the Male Sprague Dawley Rat: Possible Role for Danger
(Submitter supplied) Tienilic acid (TA) was withdrawn from the US market due to numerous cases of liver necrosis.  Two major hypotheses currently used to understand the mechanisms of idiosyncratic reactions such as TA-induced hepatotoxicity are the hapten and danger hypotheses. Both human cytochrome (CYP) P450 2C9 and the rat ortholog CYP 2C11 metabolize TA, and it was reported that a reactive metabolite of TA binds almost exclusively to these enzymes, thus acting as a mechanism-based inhibitor. more...

(Submitter supplied) Subcellular localization of RNA is an efficient way to localize proteins to a specific region of a cell. The dendritic localization of RNAs underlies the establishment and maintenance of the synaptic functions of neuronal cells. A requirement for dendritic RNA localization and subsequent local translation has been demonstrated in several forms of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. In spite of several attempts to identify these RNAs, the population of RNA species present in dendrites as a whole has not been well described. more...

2132. Dietary effect of SPI or Genistein alters rat mammary epithelial global gene expression profiles 
(Submitter supplied) The role of diet in the prevention of breast cancer is widely accepted, yet little is known on how early dietary effects mitigate adult cancer risk. Soy consumption is associated with reduced breast cancer risk in women, an effect largely attributed to the soy isoflavone genistein (GEN). We previously showed lower chemically-induced mammary tumor incidence in young adult rats with lifetime dietary intake of soy protein isolate (SPI), a highly refined soy product in infant formula, than in those fed the control diet Casein (CAS). more...

2170. Microarray analysis of the dynamics of gene expression plasticity in the supraoptic nucleus following dehydration
(Submitter supplied) The hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS) is crucial for osmoregulation. The HNS consists of the magnocellular neurons (MCNs) of the hypothalamus that have their axons terminating in the posterior pituitary. The HNS exerts its role in water balance via the release of the anti-diuretic hormone vasopressin (VP). Following dehydration VP is released into the general circulation. By binding to V2-type receptors located in the kidney, VP decrease the amount of water lost in urine. more...

(Submitter supplied) Some of the most common neurodegenerative disorders have a strong association with aging. Curiously, these conditions tend to involve specific areas of the central and peripheral nervous system, at least initially. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis preferentially targets spinal motor neurons and spares oculomotor neurons. This suggests that aging has divergent effects on brain stem and spinal cord, a factor that may explain differential susceptibility to certain neurodegenerative disorders. more...

(Submitter supplied) Inhaled anesthetics produce many effects and bind to a large number of brain proteins, but it is not yet clear if this is accompanied by widespread changes in gene expression of the biological targets.  Such changes in expression might implicate functionally important targets from the large pool of binding targets. Isolated primary cortical neurons were exposed to anesthetics and DNA oligonucleotide microarrays were used to detect and quantify transcriptional changes in neuronal tissue. more...

Repeated or prolonged stress increases the propensity for many disorders including cardiovascular disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. The susceptibility to stress is determined by a number of factors including prior experience with stress. It has been found that while there is adaptation to prolonged cold stress; it leads to sensitization when cold stressed animals are exposed to a different (novel) stressor. more...

(Submitter supplied) Neurological diseases disrupt the quality of the lives of patients and often lead to their death prematurely.  A common feature of most neurological diseases is the degeneration of neurons, which results from an inappropriate activation of apoptosis. Drugs that inhibit neuronal apoptosis could thus be candidates for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disorders.  We have identified (and recently reported) a chemical called GW5074 that inhibits apoptosis in a variety of cell culture paradigms of neuronal apoptosis. more...

The amygdala (AMY) is a brain region that is similar to HIPP across many measures, suggesting that chronic stress might modulate AMY and HIPP function in similar ways. However, studies addressing this issue have produced surprising results. For example, a regimen of chronic stress shown to produce atrophy in HIPP neurons caused dendritic branching in AMY neurons. more...

More specifically, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are much more susceptible to damage than the adjacent dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).  This dichotomy is not only seen in human Parkinsons disease, but also in many animal models of PD, including administration of the mitochondrial toxin rotenone to rats, which replicates many of the behavioral and neuropathological features of PD. more...

2363. Temporal analysis of  hippocampus in kainate-induced seizures. Koh-7K08NS002068-05-3
(Submitter supplied) Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common medically refractory epilepsy syndrome; kainic acid (KA) induced seizures have been studied as a MTLE model as limbic seizures produced by systemic injections of KA result in a distinctive pattern of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus that resembles human hippocampal sclerosis. In our "2-hit" seizure model, animals subjected to seizures during week 2 of life become more susceptible to seizures later in life and sustain extensive hippocampal neuronal injury after second KA seizures in adulthood. more...

(Submitter supplied) Neuropsychiatric consequences of poorly controlled seizures that begin in childhood can be devastating.  School failure or behavioral difficulty in a child with epilepsy is common and can become the focus of concern for families. Current antiepileptic drugs compound problems with their CNS side effects; effective therapy is currently limited as little is known about the cellular and molecular changes caused by seizures in the developing brain. more...

2365. Temporal analysis of  P15 hippocampus in kainate-induced seizures. Koh-2K08NS002068-04
(Submitter supplied) Early childhood convulsions have been correlated with hippocampal neuron loss in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Using  a "two-hit" rat seizure model, we have shown that animals subjected to kainate (KA)- or hypoxia-induced seizures during early postnatal period showed no cell death, yet sustained more extensive neuronal death after second seizures in adulthood. An early life seizure, without causing overt cellular injury, predisposes the brain to the damaging effect of seizures in later life. more...

2366. Ketogenic diet effect on hippocampus. Dingledine-5R01NS031373-10
(Submitter supplied) Epilepsy affects between 1-2% of people worldwide and is defined symptomatically by the appearance of spontaneous, recurrent seizures. The ketogenic diet (KD) is an anticonvulsant treatment that has been used to manage medically-intractable epilepsies. Both clinical and experimental reports show that the KD can be used to treat a variety of seizure types. During KD treatment, ketone bodies, rather than glucose, become the major energy substrate for the brain; somehow, metabolic conversion confers a potent anticonvulsant effect. more...

2401. Hindlimb unloading alters wound healing in ligaments
(Submitter supplied) A recent physiological study established that hindlimb unloading of rats at 3 and 7 weeks inhibits healing of injured ligaments, resulting in a badly aligned, discontinuous collagen matrix. Using tissue from these rats, we focused on the 3-week time point employing microarray analysis to identify what cellular processes or lack of processes could account for these observed deficiencies. We used the Afyymetrix RG_U34A GeneChip and performed image analysis with Microarray Suite 5.0. more...
