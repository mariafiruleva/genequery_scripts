42. RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling of hawk tea extract (HTE)-fed hypercholesterolemic rat livers
(Submitter supplied) The  high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding significantly stimulated hypercholesterolemia in male SD rats. Simultaneous feeding of hawk tea extracts (HTE) reversed the hypercholesterolemia in rats by lowering the serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the cholesterol-lowering effects of HTE, we performed the RNA-seq analysis. Consequently, the change in mRNA levels of genes invovled in metabolism of lipid and lipoprotein, primary bile acid synthesis, and ABC transporters itriggered by HFD-feeding were reversed by the co-administration of HTE (200 mg/kg/day for 11 weeks).

74. GLP-1 signaling suppresses menin's transcriptional block by phosphorylation in beta cells
(Submitter supplied) We find that GLP-1 signaling-activated PKA directly phosphorylates menin at serine 487 residue, relieving menin mediated suppression of insulin expression in beta cells and islets of diabetic GK rat. Mechanistically, GLP-1-induced PKA activation leads to menin Ser487 phosphorylation, and phosphorylated menin gains increased binding affinity to cytoskeleton proteins such as beta actin and myosin. Sequestration of Ser487 phosphorylated menin from the Ins1 gene promoter leads to reduced binding of menin-associating repressive epigenetic regulators such as SUV39H1 and HDAC1 at the locus, resulting in increased Ins1 transcription. more...

78. Gloable gene expression is affected by loss of CSB function in the rat model for Cockayne syndrome
(Submitter supplied) Cockayne syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by a deficiency in the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair pathway. Mutation of Cockayne syndrome B (CSB) affects basal transcription which is considered a major cause of CS neurological dysfunction. Here, we generated a rat model by mimicking a nonsense mutation in the CSB(ERCC6) gene of CS-B patients. CSB-deficient rats exhibit the well-known CS repair characteristics: inability to resume RNA synthesis from stalled RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and persistent gamma H2AX overexpression after UV damage. In contrast to that of the Csb-/- mouse models, the cerebella of the CSB-deficient rats are more profoundly affected. Both the molecular and the granular layers of the cerebellum cortex showed significant atrophy. The white matter of the cerebellum demonstrated high GFAP staining indicative of reactive astrogliosis. RNA-seq analysis of CSB-deficient rat cerebella revealed that even in the absence of UV damage, CSB affects the expression of hundreds of genes, many of which are neuronal genes, suggesting that transcription dysregulation could contribute to the neurological features in CSB rat models.

132. Integrative analysis of the genomic architecture of a complex kidney damage QTL in inbred hypertensive rats implies Tmem63c for translational research
(Submitter supplied) Despite recent advances in genomics, the identification of genes underlying complex diseases remains challenging. Inbred rat strains offer well-established experimental models to support the identification of susceptibility genes for diseases such as kidney damage associated with elevated blood pressure or hypertension. Here, we combined quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in two contrasting inbred rat strains with targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), compartment-specific transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), and phenotype directed follow-up translational analysis.

(Submitter supplied) We used a differential open chromatin approach, coupled with active enhancer mark ,transcriptomic and computational TFs binding analysis to map cell-type-specific active enhancers in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, and outline the TFs that control them.  We identified Tead, Sox9, Smad, Tcf, Meis, Rbpj, and Runx1 as the main cardiac fibroblasts TF groups. Our analysis shows that in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, distal enhancers, containing concentrated combinatorial clusters of multiple tissue expressed TFs recognition motifs, are combinatorically clustered around tissue specific genes.

Tetraploid complementation, through which an entire organism is produced from donor pluripotent cells, is taken as the most stringent test for pluripotency. It remains unclear whether ESCs from other species besides mice can pass this test. Here we show that the rat ESCs at very early passages are also capable to produce fertile offspring by tetraploid complementation, however, this capacity is rapidly lost during culture due to the loss of genomic imprinting. more...

(Submitter supplied) Multipotent adult resident cardiac stem cells (CSCs) originally were identified by the expression of c-kit, the stem cell factor receptor. However, in the adult myocardium c-kit alone distinguish CSCs from other c-kit-expressing cardiac cells because the adult heart contains a heterogeneous mixture of c-kitpos cells, mainly composed of mast and endothelial/progenitor cells. This heterogeneity of cardiac c-kitpos cells has not been considered in recent c-kit-expressing cell fate mapping publications, which have equated the contribution of the whole heterogeneous c-kitpos population to cardiomyocyte generation in adulthood, which is minimal, to that of the CSCs, a result at odds with previous publications. more...

238. Diverse requirements for microglial survival, specification, and function revealed by defined-medium cultures
(Submitter supplied) Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), engage in various CNS-specific functions that are critical for development and health. To better study the properties that distinguish microglia from other tissue macrophage populations, we have optimized serum-free culture conditions to permit robust survival of highly purified adult microglia under defined-medium conditions. We find that astrocyte-derived factors prevent microglial death ex vivo and that this activity results from three primary components (CSF-1/IL-34, TGF-b2, and cholesterol). Using microglial cultures that have never been exposed to serum, we demonstrate a dramatic change in intrinsic phagocytic capacity after serum exposure. Finally, we find that mature microglia rapidly lose signature gene expression profiles after isolation, and that this loss can be reversed by engrafting cells back into an intact CNS environment. These data indicate that the specialized gene expression profile of mature microglia require continuous instructive signaling from the intact CNS.  This RNA-seq dataset describes changes in rat microglial transcriptome in culture with or without serum exposure.

243. miR-219 Cooperates with miR-338 in Myelination and Promotes Myelin Repair in the CNS
(Submitter supplied) microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in oligodendrogenesis and demyelinating diseases; however, identification of individual miRNAs responsible has remained elusive. Through targeted mutagenesis, we find that miR-219 is required for proper oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in vivo. Deletion of miR-338 together with miR-219 further exacerbates hypomyelination phenotypes. Temporally specific ablation reveals a critical role for miR-219 in oligodendrocyte remyelination after demyelination, while overexpression of miR-219 promotes precocious oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin regeneration. more...

266. HNF4α transduction and 5'azacytidine treatment of rat liver progenitor cells (rLEC) to promote the hepatic phenotype
(Submitter supplied) Stem/progenitor cells represent an unlimited cell source for the generation of hepatocytes. As such, it was already shown that the hepatic liver progenitor-like cell line rLEC acquires a hepatocyte-like phenotype upon sequential exposure to hepatic growth factors and cytokines. However, expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4α is still missing, hampering their full differentiation. Therefore, we aim at studying the phenotype of rLEC by transducing the cells with HNF4α. more...

(Submitter supplied) The heart adapts to increased workload through hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes.  Although beneficial when induced physiologically by exercise, pathological cues including hypertension cause reexpression of fetal genes and dysfunctional hypertrophy, with lasting consequences for cardiac health. We hypothesised that these differences are driven by changes in chromatin-encoded cellular memory. We generated genome-wide maps of transcription and of two stable epigenetic marks, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3, specifically in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes, by selectively flow-sorting their nuclei. more...

285. Distinct Combinatorial Events Generated by ECM Degradation Dictate Cell Behavior
(Submitter supplied) It is well established that the expression profiles of multiple and possibly redundant matrix remodeling proteases (e.g. collagenases) strongly differ in health, disease and development. Although enzymatic redundancy might be inferred from their close similarity in structure, their in-vivo activity can lead to extremely diverse tissue-remodeling outcomes. We observed that proteolysis of collagen-rich natural extracellular matrix (ECM), generated uniquely by individual homologous proteases, leads to specific combinatorial events, which eventually affects overall ECM topography, visco-elastic properties and composition. more...

291. Signal-Dependent Recruitment of BRD4 to Cardiomyocyte Super-Enhancers is Suppressed by a MicroRNA [RNA-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) BRD4 governs pathological cardiac gene expression by binding acetylated chromatin, resulting in enhanced RNA polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylation and transcription elongation. Here, we describe a signal-dependent mechanism for regulation of BRD4 in cardiomyocytes. BRD4 expression is suppressed by microRNA-9 (miR-9), which targets the 3’ untranslated region of the Brd4 transcript. In response to stress stimuli, miR-9 is downregulated, leading to derepression of BRD4 and enrichment of BRD4 at long-range super-enhancers (SEs) associated with pathological cardiac genes. more...

(Submitter supplied) Although regulation of energy metabolism has been linked with multiple disorders, its role in depression and responsiveness to antidepressants is less-known. We found that an epigenetic and energetic agent, acetyl-L-carnitine (LAC, oral administration), rapidly rescued the depressive- and central and systemic metabolic-like phenotype of LAC-deficient Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats. After acute stress during LAC treatment, a subset of FSL continued to respond to LAC (rFSL), whereas the other subset did not respond (nrFSL). more...

314. Genome-wide analysis of rats' mRNA profile after knocking down PIWIL1 in embryonic cultured neurons.
(Submitter supplied) We have demonstrated that PIWIL1 can regulate neuronal radial migration during corticogenesis. In order to explore the mechanism, we carried out high-throughtput sequencing (mRNA profile) to define downstream target of PIWIL during the process of neuronal migration. And we found the expression level of several microtubule-associated proteins decreased after downregulation of PIWIL1. Therefore, PIWIL1 plays an important role in neuronal migration by regulating the expression microtubule-associated proteins (such as Map1B, Map2, Tau) .

339. Evolutionary analysis across mammals reveals distinct classes of long noncoding RNAs
(Submitter supplied) Recent advances in transcriptome sequencing have enabled the discovery of thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across many species. Though several lncRNAs have been shown to play important roles in diverse biological processes, the functions and mechanisms of most lncRNAs remain unknown. Two significant obstacles lie between transcriptome sequencing and functional characterization of lncRNAs: identifying truly non-coding genes from de novo reconstructed transcriptomes, and prioritizing the hundreds of resulting putative lncRNAs for downstream experimental interrogation. more...

342. In utero exposure of rats to high-fat diets perturbs gene-expression profiles and cancer susceptibility of prepubertal mammary glands
(Submitter supplied) Human studies suggest that high-fat diets (HFD) increase the risk of breast cancer. The 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinogenesis rat model is commonly used to evaluate the effects of lifestyle factors such as HFD on mammary-tumor risk. Past studies focused primarily on the effects of continuous maternal exposure on the risk of offspring at the end of puberty (PND50). We assessed the effects of prenatal HFD exposure on cancer susceptibility in prepubertal mammary glands and identified key gene networks associated with such disruption. more...

(Submitter supplied) Oxygen and glucose metabolism plays a pivotal role in many (patho)physiological conditions. In particular, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) occurs during ischemia and stroke, resulting in extensive tissue injury and cell death. We applied time-resolved ribosome profiling technique to assess early events at the level of gene expression in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells during short-term OGD. Most substantial alterations in transcripts levels and their translation were seen to occur in the first 20 minutes of OGD. more...

371. Peri-adolescent high-fructose diet effects on hypothalamic transcriptome
(Submitter supplied) Fructose consumption has increased by over 25% since 1970, and excess consumption has deleterious metabolic effects. Additionally, fructose can alter hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function, potentially resulting in increased vulnerability to mood disorders. Adolescents are the greatest consumers of fructose and also at a critical period of development.  Here, we examine the effects of consumption of a 55% fructose diet from weaning until adulthood on the hypothalamic transcriptome.

403. Subcellular RNA Sequencing Reveals Broad Presence of Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts in Mouse and Rat Neurons.
(Submitter supplied) Recent findings have revealed the complexity of the transcriptional landscape in mammalian cells. One recently described class of novel transcripts are the Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts (CIRTs), hypothesized to confer post-transcriptional regulatory function. For instance, the neuronal CIRT KCNMA1i16 contributes to the firing properties of hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that CIRTs may be present in a broad set of transcripts and comprise novel signals for post-transcriptional regulation. more...

407. Maternal overnutrition causes insulin resistance and alters skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation in adult rat offspring
(Submitter supplied) Maternal obesity can program metabolic syndrome in offspring but the mechanisms are not well characterized. Moreover, the consequences of maternal overnutrition in the absence of frank obesity remain poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effects of maternal consumption of a high fat-sucrose diet on the skeletal muscle metabolic and transcriptional profiles of adult offspring. Female Sprague Dawley rats were fed either a diet rich in saturated fat and sucrose (HFD, 23.5% fat, 20% sucrose wt/wt) or a standard chow diet (NFD, 7% fat, 10% sucrose w/w) for the 3 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. more...

408. Genome-wide analysis of the rat colon reveals site-specific differences in histone modifications and proto-oncogene expression
(Submitter supplied) Goal: Since disease susceptibility of the intestine exhibits an anatomical bias, we propose that the chromatin landscape, especially the site-specific epigenetic differences in histone modification patterns throughout the longitudinal axis, contributes to a differential response to chemoprotective agents. Method: We assessed the chromatin structure associated with gene expression profiles in the rat proximal and distal colon by globally correlating chromatin immunoprecipitation next-generation sequencing analysis (ChIP-Seq) with mRNA transcription (RNA-Seq) data. more...

409. Novel long non-coding RNAs are involved in cellular response to angiotensin II signaling
(Submitter supplied) Angiotensin II (AngII) is a polypeptide hormone that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), AngII signaling results in hypertrophy, proliferation, contraction, and migration, which ultimately promote atherosclerosis and hypertensive cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have shown that fundamental biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation are mediated in part by the activities of long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). more...

411. Whole-transcriptome analysis identifies re-expression of fetal splice variants in cardiac hypertrophy
(Submitter supplied) Cardiac hypertrophy has been well-characterized at the level of transcription. During cardiac hypertrophy, genes normally expressed primarily during fetal heart development are re-expressed, and this fetal gene program is believed to be a critical component of the hypertrophic process. Recently, alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts has been shown to be temporally regulated during heart development, leading us to consider whether fetal patterns of splicing also reappear during hypertrophy.We hypothesized that patterns of alternative splicing occurring during heart development are recapitulated during cardiac hypertrophy. more...

412. A Snapshot of the Hepatic Transcriptome: Ad Libitum Alcohol Intake Suppresses Expression of Cholesterol Synthesis Genes in Alcohol-Preferring (P) Rats
(Submitter supplied) Introduction: Though heavy alcohol drinking has been well characterized as causing a variety of injuries, recent epidemiological evidence in humans suggests moderate consumption may provide beneficial effects. For example, there exists a J- or U-shaped relationship between the level of alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease risk. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of these positive consequences by identifying which genes are responsive to moderate alcohol intake in the liver, the primary site for alcohol metabolism. more...

414. Evolutionary dynamics of gene and isoform regulation in mammalian tissues
(Submitter supplied) Most mammalian genes produce multiple distinct mRNAs through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is not clear.  To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced cDNA from 9 tissues from 4 mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth.  We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. more...
